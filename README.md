# RECTANGLE-PROGRAM-USING-CLASS-IN-C-

          #TASK1
          -------
Write the definition for a class called Rectangle that has floating point data members

length and width. The class has the following member functions:

void setlength(float)r

void setwidth(float)

float perimeter()

float area()

void show()

int sameArea(Rectangle) that has one parameter of type Rectangle. sameArea returns 1 if the

two Rectangles have the same area, and returns 0 if they don't.

1. Write the definitions for each of the above member functions.

2. Write main function to create two rectangle objects. Set the length and width of the first

rectangle to 5 and 2.5. Set the length and width of the second rectangle to 5 and 18.9. Display

each rectangle and its area and perimeter.



3. Check whether the two Rectangles have the same area and print a message indicating the result.

Set the length and width of the first rectangle to 15 and 6.3. Display each Rectangle and its area

and perimeter again. Again, check whether the two Rectangles have the same area and print a

message indicating the result.
